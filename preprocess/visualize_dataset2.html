<tr> <td>cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it. A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky - and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them. If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets. Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. whispered Professor McGonagall. asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog. "S-s-sorry," sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply. Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. </td></tr>

<tr> <td>He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets - but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day. </td></tr>

It looked like hard work. Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. Uncle Vernon chuckled. At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried. she snarled. she cried, flinging her arms around him. Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: "MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY!" </td></tr>

<tr> <td>Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. He shuffled away. Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. He looked back at the snake and winked, too. The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. The snake nodded vigorously. Harry asked. The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened - one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, "Go - cupboard - stay - no meals," before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy. Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. There were no photographs of them in the house. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look. That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water. he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question. Harry looked in the bowl again. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High - like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table. They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat. Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:Mr. H. Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet DriveLittle Whinging SurreyThe envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp. shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. He chuckled at his own joke. said the girl. She said all this very fast. </td></tr>
